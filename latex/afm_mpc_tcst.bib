  abstract =      {We evaluate the performance of a dual-adaptive
                   feedforward control architecture applied to the
                   raster scan of a piezo-based positioning system. In
                   previous work [1], we introduced the adaptive-delay
                   algorithm that improved the tracking performance of
                   the feedforward plant-injection architecture. The key
                   benefit of the adaptive-delay algorithm is the
                   adaptation calculation that does not require
                   knowledge of plant parameters. In [1], the algorithm
                   uses model-inverse-based feedforward control to
                   increase raster-tracking bandwidth. It is well known
                   that model-inverse-based feedforward control designs
                   can perform poorly in the presence of large model
                   variation or uncertainty. System identification
                   methods reveal that the frequency response of our
                   piezoscanner includes a large amount of variation as
                   the user requests various operating points within the
                   stage's range. As a result, tracking performance
                   degrades as we vary from the conditions with which
                   the model was identified. To correct for this, we
                   combined the adaptive-delay algorithm with
                   partial-parameter adaptation that updates critically
                   variant parameters. This partnership of adaptive
                   feedforward controllers improved experimental
                   tracking results and robustness to model
                   uncertainties.},

                   approach to compensate for dynamic and hysteresis
                   effects in piezoactuators with application to AFM
                   technology. To handle the coupled behavior of
                   dynamics and hysteresis, a cascade model is presented
                   to enable the application of inversion-based
                   feedforward control. The dynamics, which include
                   vibration and creep, are modeled using linear
                   transfer functions. A frequency-based method is used
                   to invert the linear model to find an input that
                   compensates for vibration and creep. The inverse is
                   noncausal for nonminimum-phase systems. Similarly,
                   the hysteresis is handled by an inverse-Preisach
                   model. To avoid the complexity of finding the
                   inverse-Preisach model, high- gain feedback control
                   can be used to linearize the system's behavior. A
                   feedforward input is then combined with the feedback
                   system to compensate for the linear dynamics to
                   achieve high-speed AFM imaging. Finally, recent
                   efforts in feedforward control for an SPM application
                   including the use of iteration to handle hysteresis
                   as well as uncertainties and variations in the system
                   model is discussed.},

  abstract =      {Atomic force microscopy is a powerful tool that has
                   had a tremendous impact in understanding systems with
                   nanometer-scale features. In this work we explore the
                   use of compressed sensing as a means of sampling data
                   and generating an image. Under this approach only a
                   small number of the pixels in an image, typically as
                   few as 10\%, need to be sampled to generate an
                   accurate image. We show that when combined with
                   time-optimal control to move the tip of the
                   microscope between measurement locations, the imaging
                   time is comparable to high-speed AFM systems while
                   also greatly reducing the interactions with and force
                   applied to the sample. In addition, the approach can
                   significantly reduce the imaging time in applications
                   such as force mapping in which the tip is moved
                   point-by-point through a sequence of measurement
                   locations rather than continuously scanned as in
                   standard imaging.},

  abstract =      {Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) is a powerful tool for
                   nano-size imaging. The advantage of AFM is that it
                   can get extraordinary high resolution image at atom
                   level. However, AFM obtains the sample topography
                   image through scanning on the top of sample line by
                   line, therefore it takes couples minutes to get an
                   image and this negative point makes it difficult to
                   continuously observe surface change during
                   manipulation. In this paper, a novel approach for
                   compressive sensing based video rate AFM imaging
                   system is proposed. In this method, compressive
                   sensing is used for sampling topography information
                   of sample surface efficiently. Compressive sensing
                   could use fewer measurements for data sensing to
                   recovery the image through image reconstruction
                   algorithm. This technique decreases the scanning time
                   for AFM scanner because of fewer measurements needed.
                   The video rate for this new approach could reach as
                   high as 1.75 seconds per frame.},

                   application of compressed sensing (CS) to image
                   acquisition in atomic force microscopy (AFM), with
                   the goal of improving the temporal resolution of the
                   instrument by reducing the amount of data that needs
                   to be acquired to create a high-quality image. In
                   traditional CS, each measurement is, by design, a
                   linear combination of the elements of the signal
                   under study. In AFM however, the physics of the
                   sensing process require that each measurement
                   contains information about only a single point. The
                   measurement matrix introduced here takes this into
                   account and allows the user to balance image
                   acquisition time against image quality. The proposed
                   method is demonstrated through simulation. These
                   simulations show faithful recovery with a reduction
                   in imaging time on the order of a factor of five. By
                   accepting a reduction in image reconstruction
                   quality, additional gains in imaging time of ten
                   times or more, were achieved.},

                   to resource-constrained embedded platforms. We
                   propose several custom computational architectures
                   for different first-order optimization methods that
                   can handle linear-quadratic MPC problems with input,
                   input-rate, and soft state constraints. We provide
                   analysis ensuring the reliable operation of the
                   resulting controller under reduced precision
                   fixed-point arithmetic. Implementation of the
                   proposed architectures in FPGAs shows that
                   satisfactory control performance at a sample rate
                   beyond 1 MHz is achievable even on low-end devices,
                   opening up new possibilities for the application of
                   MPC on embedded systems.},

                   models from transfer function data has been
                   developed. It takes advantage of the strengths of
                   three separate model ID methods. The eigensystem
                   realisation algorithm is used to generate a model,
                   and then a curve fit based on the complex log of the
                   transfer functions is used to reduce the model.
                   Finally, the model is fine-tuned using a curve fit to
                   the transfer function data directly. This method has
                   been shown to work well on the SERC Interferometric
                   Testbed, a system with many lightly-damped, closely

                   the electric domain for PEAs. Based on this

                   describe the relationship between the input voltage
                   and the output displacement of a PEA. Then a
                   procedure is developed to identify the parameters of

                   carried out using the measured input and output of a

                   an open-loop positioning application of PEAs.
                   Simulation and experiments are carried out to

                   for nanoparticles with overall sizes on the order of
                   10 nm has been hampered in the past by the large
                   spatial uncertainties encountered in tip positioning.
                   This paper addresses the compensation of nonlinear
                   effects of creep and hysteresis on the piezo scanners
                   which drive most AFMs. Creep and hysteresis are
                   modeled as the superposition of fundamental
                   operators, and their inverse model is obtained by
                   using the inversion properties of the
                   Prandtl-Ishlinskii operator. Identification of the
                   parameters in the forward model is achieved by a
                   novel method that uses the topography of the sample
                   and does not require position sensors. The identified
                   parameters are used to compute the inverse model,
                   which in turn serves to drive the AFM in an
                   open-loop, feedforward scheme. Experimental results
                   show that this approach effectively reduces the
                   spatial uncertainties associated with creep and
                   hysteresis, and supports automated,
                   computer-controlled manipulation operations that

                   faster, cheaper and more power-efficient solvers for
                   convex programs than is currently offered by
                   software-based solutions. In this paper we present
                   the first field programmable gate array (FPGA)
                   implementation of a fast gradient solver for
                   linear-quadratic MPC problems with input constraints.
                   We use fixed-point arithmetic to exploit the

                   analytical guarantees ensuring no overflow errors
                   occur during operation. We further prove that the
                   arithmetic errors due to round-off can lead only to
                   reduced accuracy, but not instability, of the fast

  abstract =      {Model predictive control (MPC) is an on-line control
                   technique originally developed for slow processes
                   which makes an assessment between input effort and
                   output error while respecting constraints on inputs
                   and outputs. Due to improved computing power and
                   algorithms, MPC is nowadays also applied to
                   mechatronic systems. For these systems, achieving
                   minimal settling time is the main concern, while the
                   input cost is usually of less importance. Hence, this
                   paper presents a new type of MPC; time optimal MPC
                   (TOMPC) which minimizes the settling time of the
                   system. Theoretical considerations show that TOMPC is
                   stabilizing. Simulations show the merits of this
                   technique and indicate that it is applicable in
                   real-time.},
