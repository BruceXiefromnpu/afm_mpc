\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:orge362f71}

Point-to-point movements by AFM is also of interest in other areas like visceolastic property mapping \cite{killgore_visceolastic_2011}.

In the context of CS, we are interested in rapidly moving the AFM stage between setpoints. The setpoints define either discrete measurement locations or the start of a new \(\mu\) -path scan. In earlier work, we found while exploring the limits of achievable with plain linear feedback that the change in the control input, \(\Delta u(k)\) was the limiting factor. We  \cite{braker_application_2017}, \cite{braker_fast_2017} took the viewpoint of trying to achieve a stable system for a equivalent given feedback gain in the face of rate-of change saturation. The methods we chose for doing this were using model predictive control (MPC) and tracking an optimal trajectory generated by solving a contrained, linear quadratic regulator problem (CLQR). In both cases, we considered a standard quadratic cost function

\begin{align}
V(z,v) &= \min_{v} z_{N}Q_{p}z_{N} + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}z_{i}^{T}Qz_{i} + v^{T}_{i}Rv_{i}\\
 \text{s.t.}&\\
z_{i+1} &= Az_{i} + Bv_{i}\\
z_{0} &= x_{k}\\
|v_i - v_{i-1}| &\coloneqq |\Delta v(i)| \leq (\Delta u)_{max}
\label{eqn:opt}
\end{align}

The essential difference between the MPC scheme and the trajectory tracking scheme is that the optimzition in MPC solved repetaly online, and the control input given to the system is \(v(0)\). In the trajectory tracking scheme, the optimization is solved offline and the resulting optimal input trajectory is fed to the system in a feedforward manner while state feedback tracks the optimal state sequence. In both cases, the weight \(Q, R)\) were chosen via an inverse optimal control problem, such that the associated linear feedback (in the infinite horizon, unconstrained LQR problem) would place the poles with the desired damping. 

It was our conclusion that both methods are effective at extending the stable range of a given \((Q,R)\) pair in the face of \(\Delta u\) saturation. The attractiveness of MPC here is that it does not depend on defining a list a setpoints to visit a-priori. The downside to MPC is that to significantly expand the region of rechable setpoints requires a large control horizon. Our MPC implementation used the Fast Graident Method (FGM) to solve the quadratic program associated with \eqref{eqn:opt}. Unfortunately, the convergence rate of the FGM depends heavily on the condition number of the Hessian matrix of the QP. Several factors contribute to a poorly conditioned Hessian matrx: (1) long control horizon (2), aggressive (Q,R) weights. The other factor limiting the horizon length in MPC is that the problem size grows, making the QP more difficult to solve within the required sampletime. 

The question which naturually arises from our prior work and which is the main topic of this study, is "how much \emph{time} is actually saved with either MPC or CLQR tracking?" In essence, the reachable set of setpoints using pure linear feedback can be expanded by de-rating the linear feedback gain. While we might expect this to result in a slower settling time, the question we seek to answer is \emph{how much slower}? In short, are the more complicated methods worth it?

A second related question is \emph{if you're going to go through the trouble of generating and tracking an optimal trajectory, why not track the time-optimal trajectory?}

We will answer both of these questions in this paper. 

\section{Experimental Testbed}\label{sec:testbed}

  \end{minipage}
  
\end{figure*}

The AFM in our lab consists of an Agilent 5400 which has been retrofited with an nPoint NPXY100A piezo stage, which provides lateral movement of the sample. The NPXY100A is driven by an nPoint C300. The C300 amplifies the low voltage ($\pm~10$ volts) control inputs to a high voltage signal which drives the piezo stage and provides signal conditioning for the capacitive position sensors in the stage. All control logic is programmed into a Xilinx FPGA in a cRIO 9082 from National Instruments.

In characterizing the limitations of this system, it will be helpful to enable direct measurements of both the high voltage output, $V_X$, and current, $I_X$, of the C300. These are obtained by re-routing the C300 drive signal as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:c300_meas}. The voltage divider output provides a (scaled) measurement of the C300 output voltage and is given by
\begin{equation}
V_X = \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_2}V_{div}
\end{equation}
Note that the impedance of the divider is high (about $32.5\text{M}\Omega$) to avoid perturbing the amplifier output.

A small, $0.1~\Omega$ resistor on the return side of the piezo provides a current measurement of $I_X$. The voltage across this resistor is amplified by an op-amp circuit so that
\begin{equation}
I_{X} = \frac{V_{op}}{K_{op}R_{\text{sense}}}
\end{equation}
where $K_{op}$ is the gain of the operational amplifier.

\section{System Modeling}
To keep the discussion manageable, we will concentrate the discussion to the $x$-direction. We will model the overall plant for the $X$-direction as three cascaded systems: $\mathcal{H}$ which models the hysteresis of the piezo, a drift  $G_d$ and a vibrational model $G_{vib}$. In general, the effects of hysteresis are most noticeable when moving across wide ranges. Thus, by using relatively small input signals, the drift and vibrational dynamics can be identified separately from the hysteresis. Here, we model both the $G_{vib}$ and $G_d$ as linear time-invariant systems. The modes of the vibrational dynamics are over an order of magnitude faster than the modes in the linear drift mode, which allows the two systems to be easily separted in the identification.  the drift as a linear systemThe dynamics of drift are predominantly low frequency while vibrational aspects on the other hand are fast by comparison. These differences can be exploited to develop each model separately. This cascaded structure is shown in \ref{fig:whole_plant}. Modeling these three components is the subject of the next three subsections.

% \end{figure*}

\subsection{Modeling $G_{vib}$}
Here, we are concerned with the transfer function from the low voltage control signal to the stage's position, $G_{X,u_X}$. To obtain an experimental frequency response of $G_{X,u_X}$, we use a stepped-sines method (single frequency at a time). The amplitude of the driving sinusoid is chosen to be small enough that the effects of hysteresis are minimized. After the system reaches steady-state, the input and output signals are demodulated into their first (complex) Fourier coefficients, the ratio of which yields the frequency response at that frequency. One advantage of the stepped-sines methods is that we can consider the normalized residual energy in the output signal
\begin{equation}
E_r(\omega) = \frac{\sum_{k} |y_k|^2 - |Y_1(\omega)|^2}{\sum_{k} |y_k|^2}
\end{equation}
where $Y_1(\omega)$ is the first Fourier coefficient and $y_k$ is the output signal at time $k$. A very small $E_r$ indicates that nearly all of the energy is contained in $Y_1(\omega)$ and therefore that the system response is largely described by linear dynamics. Conversely, a large $E_r$ indicates that $y_k$ is corrupted by either noise or non-linearities. 

\begin{figure}

  \includesvg[width=01\linewidth]{figures/G_uz2stage_Eres.svg}

  \label{fig:Guz2stage_frf}
\end{figure}
% However, to characterize the limitations of the C300 it will also be helpful to consider the transfer functions enumerated in Table~\ref{tab:TFS}. 
% Note the large amounts of phase lag in both $G_{pow}$ and $G_{stage}$. This is due to the C300 including its own DSP which cannot be turned off, even when run in open loop mode.

% \end{table}


To obtain a parametric models of $G_{X,u_X}$ for control design involves two steps. We obtain a preliminary model using an Eigenspace Realization Algorithm (ERA). In general the ERA will not produce a model with poles at $z=0$, which is what we need in order to model the delay. Thus, the delay in the frequency response is divided out before passing it to the ERA algorithm. The ERA does a fair job of identifying the resonances and anti-resonances. However, it gets the relative degree wrong.

Thus, the second step is to use the model generated by the ERA as the initial guess to a non-linear least squares problem \cite{sidman_parametric_1991} which minimizes the ratio of the logarithm of the experimental frequency response to that of the model. Though Sidman et al. develop the idea for a continuous time models, their strategy is easily adapted to fit a discrete time model. The optimization is given by
\begin{align}
\min_{\theta} \sum_{i=1}^M| \log(G(e^{j\omega_iT_s})) - \log(\hat{G}(e^{j\omega_iT_s}|\theta))|^2
\label{eqn:logfit}
\end{align}
where $\omega_i$ is each frequency in the experimental frequency response and $\hat{G}(e^{j\omega_iT_s}|\theta)$ is the model parametrized by the vector $\theta$. $\hat{G}(z|\theta)$ is composed of first and second-order factors
\begin{equation}
  \hat{G}(z|\theta) =k \frac{\prod (z-b_i) \prod(z^2 +b_jz + b_{j+1})}
  { \prod_{l=1}(z-a_l) \prod(z^2 +a_mz + a_{m+1})}z^{-p}. \label{eqn:mode_struc}
\end{equation}
Because the logarithm of the products is the sum of the logarithms, the Jacobian for the cost function is surprisingly easy to calculate. Details can be found in \cite{sidman_parametric_1991}.

The model structure \eqref{eqn:mode_struc} includes a fractional delay $z^{-p}$. This allows us to include the delay as a term in the decision variable and obviates the need to optimize over integers. This is further beneficial because we are not guaranteed that the latency from input to output is an exact integer and allowing a fractional delay helps the optimization to more accurately match the phase. In the final model, we round $p$ to the nearest integer. 

In this work, we do not model the modes above 1100~Hz. Thus, the optimization \eqref{eqn:logfit} is only done over frequency up to 1100~Hz.

\subsection{Power Amplifier Characterization and Limitations}\label{sec:powcharct}
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\includesvg[width=1\linewidth]{figures/G_pow_and_current.svg}
\caption{\label{fig:orgc576458}

The solid black is the transfer function from low voltage control to power amplifier output current $G_{V_X, u_X}$, which is upper-bounded by the dotted-back curve representing $\tilde G_{I_X, u_x}$, a pure discrete derivative.}
\end{figure}

The high voltage output of the C300 is current limited to 100 mA. If the electrical impedance of the piezo is modeled as a pure capacitance (a common assumption  ~\cite{fleming_megahertz_2009, Bazghaleh_digital_2013}), this translates to a rate of change limitation on the voltage control signal through the relation $\dot v_{h} = \frac{1}{C} i_c(t)$. 

It is tempting to think that we ought to constrain the rate of change of the power amplifier voltage output $V_X$, since this is the voltage actually running through the piezo. There are two difficulties with this approach. First, as seen in Fig~\ref{fig:org8f9b1d0}, \(G_{V_{x},u_{x}}\) rolls off at about 250~Hz, which means that such a constraint will lead to a constraint on the states of \(G_{V_{x},u_{x}}\). Second, the transfer function \(G_{I_{x}, V_{X}}\) has a break frequency at about 700~Hz, where it begins increasing at 40~dB per decade. Thus, a rate of change limitation based on a pure capacitance would \emph{under}-estimate the actual current draw.

However, if we consider \(G_{I_{x},u_{x}}\) we see that a pure derivative \emph{over}-estimates the actual current draw. 
In other words, 
\begin{equation}
G_{I_{X},u_{X}}(e^{j\omega T_{s}}) \leq k_d(z-1), \quad \forall \omega \in[0, \pi/T_s]
\end{equation}
where, from our experimental data, $k_d=0.506$. The bound $k_d(z-1)$ is shown as the dotted-black curve in Fig.~\ref{fig:orgc576458}. Thus, for all inputs,
\begin{align}
|I_{X}(k)| &\leq k_d(u_X(k) - u_X(k-1)|
\end{align}
Thus, we need to enforce
\begin{equation}
|\Delta u_X(k)| \leq I_{\text{max}}/k_d = 0.198, \label{eqn:du_limit}
\end{equation}
where $I_{\text{max}} = 0.1$~A.

We note that this condition is more conservative than is strictly necessary, since a pure derivative overestimates the amount of actual current draw. Ideally, we would develop a parametric model of \(G_{I_{x},u_{x}}\) and enforce a constraint on the output of that model. However, such an approach renders the constraint set for $u_X$ complex and is it not feasible to solve that problem using the fast gradient method. In our experimental implementations, we will enforce \eqref{eqn:du_limit}. However, in Section~\ref{sec:time_save_analysis} we will consider how much performance is given up through this method via a simulation study. 


\section{Control Setup}
\subsection{The Incremental Form}
The constraint \eqref{eqn:du_limit} can be remodeled as a pure saturating constraint if we work with an incremental form of \(G_{X,u_x}\) which has as its input \({\Delta u(k)\coloneqq u(k)-u(k-1)}\), rather than \(u\). To this end, we augment \(G_{X,u_X}\) with a state \(\x_{\text{u}}(k)\) such that
\begin{equation*}
  \x_u(k) = u(k-1).
\end{equation*}
It follows that
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
  \xd(k+1)
  &=
    \begin{bmatrix}
      A & B\\ 0 & I
    \end{bmatrix}
    \xd(k)
    +
    \begin{bmatrix}
      B\\I
    \end{bmatrix}
  \Delta u(k) \\
  \y(k) & = \begin{bmatrix}C & 0\end{bmatrix}\xd(k)\\
  \xd(k)& \coloneqq \begin{bmatrix}\x(k)\\\x_u(k) \end{bmatrix}\\
  \xd(0) & = \begin{bmatrix}\x(0)\\u(-1)\end{bmatrix}. \label{eqn:x0_aug}
\end{align}\label{eqn:ssdelta}%
\end{subequations}
We call this system \(\Gd = \{\Ad, \Bd, \Cd, 0\}\), which has \({\tilde{n}_s=21}\) states, 9 of which model delay.
To solve the setpoint tracking problem, we work in the error
coordinates of \(\Gd\).
For an arbitrary reference \(\y_r\), in steady state we have \({\du_{ss}=0}\) and \(\xdss =N_{\xi}\y_r\) where \({N_{\xi}\in\mathds{R}^{\tilde{n}_s\times n_u} }\) is found by solving
\begin{align}
  \begin{bmatrix}N_{\xi} \\ N_u\end{bmatrix} &=
\begin{bmatrix}I-\Ad & -\Bd\\\Cd & 0\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}0\\ I\\\end{bmatrix}\label{eqn:nxnu},
\end{align}
which, due to the augmented pole at $z=1$, will give \(N_u\equiv 0\). 
The error state, \({\xde(k)=\xd(k) - \xdss}\) has dynamics
\begin{align}
  \xde(k+1) & = \Ad\xd(k) + \Bd\dd u(k) - \xdss \nonumber\\
            & = \Ad \xde(k)   + \Bd \dd u(k)\nonumber
\end{align}
because $\xdss$ is in the nullspace of $(I - \Ad)$.

\subsection{Observer Design}

We use the method outlined in \cite{doyle_robustness_1979}.

\subsection{Control Weight Selection}
To design the weighting matrices $Q$, $R$ and $S$, we design fictitious output matrices $\hat C$ and $\hat D$ such that zeros of $\{A, B, \hat C, \hat D\}$ are at the desired pole locations. Then, the fictitious output is $\hat y = \hat C x + \hat D u$. If we write the cost function of REF as
\begin{align}
  J &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \hat{y_i}^T\hat{y_i} + u_i^T\gamma u_i\\
    &= \sum_{i=0}^{N-1} \hat{x_i}^TQ\hat{x_i} + 2x_i^TSu_i + u_i^TRu_i\\
\end{align}
where $Q = \hat{C}^T\hat{C}$, $S =\hat{C}^T \hat{D}$, and $R = \gamma + \hat{D}^T\hat{D}$. As $\gamma$ becomes small, the closed loop poles of the unconstrained LQR will move to the zeros of $\{A, B, \hat C, \hat D\}$. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:lqr_locus}. One can usually take $\gamma$ to be small enough that the difference between the desired pole location and its actual location is negligible. The direct feedthrough term $\hat D$ results in the cross-weighting term $S$ and is necessary if we wish to endow the fictitious system with $n_s$ zeros in order to place all $n_s$ poles.

Through elementary block row and column operations, it is straightforward to show that the zeros of
$\{A, B, \hat C, \hat D\}$ are the same as the generalized eigenvalues of
\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
    (A - B\hat{D}^{-1}\hat{C}) & 0\\
    0 & \hat{D}
  \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}
Thus, we choose $\hat D = 1$ and find $\hat C$ via standard pole placement techniques.

  \caption{Root locus for $R_o + \gamma$. Note that for clarity, the plant zeros are not shown. The black 'x's indicate the poles of the open-loop plant. The blue circles indicate the fictitious zeros, which are at the location of the desired poles. }
  \label{fig:lqr_locus}
\end{figure}

\section{The Optimal Control formulations}
We want to look at a few different ways of driving the stage from point to point as rapidly as possible, yet still be practical. Inspired by our past work, we will compare several methods through both simulation and experimental studies. These methods are
\begin{itemize}
\item\emph{Discrete time, minimum time optimal control (DTMT)}
\item\emph{Saturated Linear state feedback (SLF)} The basic idea here to use standard linear state feedback which is saturated (on $\Delta u$) but to de-rate the design such that the closed-loop system is demonstrably stable up to a certain reference size. 
\item\emph{Constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC)} The goal with MPC is that, instead of fully de-rating the design to account for the slew rate constraint, to directly account for the constraint as part of the control law itself. Do to limitations on the implementation, MPC must still be de-rated to some extent to be implementable, since the length of control horizon needed to achieve stabilty over the full range of the stage becomes large for an aggressive design.
\item\emph{Constrained, Finite horizon LQR (CLQR)} The optimization is the same as the MPC optimization, just over a much longer horizon. Similarly to the DTMT idea, this would be implemented in a feedforward/tracking configuration. However, the broader goal of considering this scheme is that it shows how much optimality we have sacrificed with a relatively short horizon in MPC.
\end{itemize}

The last three control schemes can be described by the optimization
\begin{align}
V(z,v) &= \min_{v} z_{N}Q_{p}z_{N} + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}z_{i}^{T}Qz_{i} + v^{T}_{i}Rv_{i}\\
 \text{s.t.}&\\
z_{i+1} &= Az_{i} + Bv_{i}\\
z_{0} &= x_{k}\\
|v_i - v_{i-1}| &\coloneqq |\Delta v(i)| \leq (\Delta u)_{max}.\label{eqn:optconst}
\end{align}
In the case of MPC, the control at the current time step as taken $v_0$, the rest of the optimal controls are thrown away and the optimization is repeated at the next sampling instant. Here, we consider control horizons ranging from $N=4$ to $N=20$. In the case of CLQR, we consider a much longer control horizon of $N=400$. The idea then is to apply the optimal control to the system and track the optimal system output. For SLF, we set $N=1$ and eliminate the constraint \eqref{eqn:optconst}. Because we have taken $Q_p$ as the solution to the discrete algebraic Riccatti equation, this is equivalent to the standard infinite horizon LQR problem. In the case of CLF $\Delta u_k$ is saturated in software, which is more predictable than allowing it happen in hardware and ensures that the control applied to the plant matches the control seen by the state estimator.

In CLQR, MPC and CLF,  the state weight $Q$ is selected via an inverse optimal control problem to yield good damping and to cancel the real pole-zero pair near 50~Hz. For MPC and CLF, we treat control weight $\gamma$ as the primary tuning parameter. In both cases, a larger $\gamma$ yields a larger maximum step size that can be tracked. Essentially, we can view each control 

\subsection{The minimum-time control problem in discrete-time}\label{sec:mintime}
\label{sec:org6d1d6b6}
In discrete-time, the minimum-time control problem can be stated as \cite{chen_minimumtime_cca}
\begin{align}
\min_{u(0), u(1),\dots,u(N-1)} & N\\
\text{s.t.}&\\
x_{k+1} & = Ax_{k} + Bu_{k}\\
x_{N} & = x_{f}\\
u_{k}&\in \mathds{K},~k=0,\dots,N-1\\
x_{k} &\neq x_{f},~k=0,\dots,N-1.
\end{align}
where $x_f$ is the desired final target state. 
For a given control sequence $\{u_0,\dots, u_{N-1}\}$, and an initial condition $x_0$, the state $x_N$ at the final time is given by
\begin{equation}
X_N = A^Nx_0 + \sum_{i=0}^{N-1}A^{N-1-i}Bu_i.
\end{equation}
Practically, the problem can be solved using a bisection method which searches for the smallest feasible \(N\). In these cases, the bisection search solves sub-problem given by
\begin{align}
\min_{U}& || x_{f} - x_{N}||\\
\text{s.t.} &\\
x_{k+1} & = Ax_{k} + Bu_{k}\\
u_{k}&\in \mathds{K},~k=0,\dots,N-1\\
\end{align}
For a given \(N\), if \(||x_{f} - x_{N}|| < \text{TOL}\), the sub-problem returns successful, otherwise it fails. The goal then is to find a the smallest \(N\) that succeeds. 

It is also worth pointing out that the solution to this problem, in contrast to continuous time systems is not in general bang-bang CITE.

% When we consider comparing the settling time of our LQR inspired methods to the time-optimal solution, we need to be careful.
% The reason is that the time optimal solution requires all the states to have reached steady at $x_f$. Consequently, the total move, if we compute the time-optimal trajectory for $G$, will be dominated by the slow pole at 220 Hz. This is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:slowpz_to}.

% \end{figure}
% In some sense, the slow pole-zero pair is a first order drift model, so we call it $G_{drift}$. Then, the total transfer function from the control to the piezo stage position can be factored as $G(z) = G_{drift}\hat{G}(z)$. The idea then, is to compute the time-optimal trajectory for $\hat{G}(z)$. This results in optimal trajectories for the control input, $u^*$ and plant output $y^*$ for $\hat{G}$. That optimal control sequence is will then be run through a feedforward filter which inverts the dynamics of $G_{drift}$. The scheme is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:bd_ff_to}

\section{Quantifying the time savings (if any) of MPC and d-rated linear feedback}
\label{sec:org7edf36d}
The goal of this section is to quantify the time savings (if any) of using MPC vs SLF. While is is certainly true that for a given feedback gain (i.e., $(Q,R)$ pair), we can extend the stable range of setpoints. However, that does not tell us how much time we save with that strategy. To be able to make this comparison, we need a way to decide when a trajectory is unstable, or more generally, unacceptable. The most niave way to this would be to just look at the settling time over a sufficiently long simulation: if the trajectory never settles into the settle boundary, we decide the system was unstable for that setpoint size. The trouble with this is that there is a middle ground, where the trajectory will actually settle, but spends a lot of time oscillating (in some non-linear fashion) before it gets there. This is illustrated in Fig. REF.


\subsection{Rejection Metrics}\label{sec:metrics}
There are several ways we might think about doing this. 
For a given $\gamma$, we need a way to decide if the trajectory which results from either SLF or MPC is acceptable for a given setpoint size.

Ultimately, we have decided to do is to compare the trajectory resulting from MPC or SLF with the one from CLQR: if the settling time is greater than 20\% of the CLQR trajectory, we decide that the current setpoint was too large.


\begin{enumerate}
\item We start with a nominal \((Q,R)\) pair.
\item We determine how large we must make \(\gamma R\) to visit a certain size of setpoint. In general, the larger \(\gamma\) is, the larger the maximum setpoint we can visit is. This is what I mean by "de-rating" the feedback gain and is illustrated below in Figur.
\end{enumerate}


Note that each point in that plot was generated by simulated the linear feedback law with saturation starting from a very small setpoint and incrementing larger (by 0.1 I think) until the output becomes unstable. 

So the questions I want to answer are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Given a maximum setpoint \(ref_{max}\), how much time do we \textbf{loose} by making \(\gamma\) large? Said another way, what is the time penalalty for needing to visit larger setpoints (since this implies that \(K\) must be "smaller")?
\item How does this time compare to what we can acheive with MPC?
\end{enumerate}


The way I think it makes sense to think about these questions is to compare the settling times to the optimal, constrained finite horizon (CLQR) open-loop settling time. At least for a given quadratic cost, that is typically the best settling time we can hope to achieve, and we won't run into the problems with MPC where need a larger control horizon to get stability. 

\begin{figure}

% \caption{both}
\end{figure}

The result of running a parameter sweep this way is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:maxsp_by_gam}. What the figure shows is, for CLF, and several values of the MPC control horizon, the maximum setpoint that can be tracked for a given control weight $\gamma$. In the figure $\gamma$ ranges from 10 to 5000 in XX increments. For each value of $\gamma$, we performed successively larger step-input simulations between and 12 v. The $y$-axis value indicates that that value of reference resulted in a deteriorated or unstable trajectory, and is thus the largest track-able setpoint for the given gamma.

\section{Time Savings Analysis}\label{sec:time_save_analysis}
The goal of doing this is to essentially look at several cross sections Fig.~\ref{fig:maxsp_by_gam} and look at how the settling time changes between CLF and different MPC control horizons \emph{for a given desired maximum setpoint.}

Here, we choose several desired $r_{max}$ values and consider how much time is saved over the time optimal solution for the different strategies. We choose $r_{max}$ as 2.5, 5.0 and 10. These values are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:maxsp_by_gam} by the dotted black lines. Where those dotted black lines cross the various curves indicates the $\gamma$ that is required.

\begin{figure*}
  \begin{minipage}{0.32\textwidth}

  \end{minipage}
    \begin{minipage}{0.32\textwidth}

  \caption{The percentage increase over the time-optimal solution for CLF (orange), the CLQR solution (blue) and the MPC strategy for control horizons ranging from $N=4$ to $N=20$. }
  \label{fig:perc_inc}
\end{figure*}
Our takeaway from this study is that there appears to very little benefit in terms of time saved for implemented the CLQR or MPC control strategies. The largest difference in the percent increase is only in the range of 10\%, and for the smaller $r_{max}=2.5$, this difference is even smaller. 

\section{Experimental Comparison}\label{sec:exp_comp}
Our simulation results indicate that we may as well use CLF or track the time-optimal trajectory, if we can get away with it. But what about the real world?
